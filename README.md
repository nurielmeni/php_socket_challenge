## About The Project

This is a project that was requested for showing my abilities in PHP:

### Project Specs
    The task is to create socket server on PHP, listening to port 1111 (console
    script application).
    User can connect to the server from any IP (or locally) by regular telnet
    client, and receive menu with next function items:
    1. Get disk space (total on the Server)
    2. Get ping average to 8.8.8.8
    3. Request string from the user and print top 5 search results from Google
    (URL strings)
    4. Exit

    - OOP usage - must.
    - Server with ability to receive multiple connections simultaneously â€“
    big advantage.
